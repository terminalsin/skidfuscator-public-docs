# Writing Exclusions (Skidfuscator >= 2.0.0)

Understanding exclusions might be tricky at first, but trust me, it is quite easy once you get the hang of it. First and foremost, it's
important to understand basic regex. 

## Basics of Regex (Regular expressions)

- Here's a basic string to match everything:
```java
(.*?)
```

So the following would happen:
```java
abozeofez // Matches!
zeigzoegze // Matches!
```

***

- To match any string which contains "roar", you'd have
```java
roar
````

So the following would happen:
```java
roar // Matches!
asdafroar // Matches!
grrr // No match!
```

***

To match any string which begins _with_ "uwu", you'd have:
```java
^uwu
```

So the following would happen:
```java
kitty-uwu // Matches!
uwu-kitty // No match!
```

## Writing exclusions

Now, you'll want to create an exclusion file, and here you'll be able to mess around. Skidfuscator reads inclusions and exclusions the same way: if it matches a regex pattern, __**it will not be read or obfuscated**__. 

### Exclusions
Writing an exclusion is relatively simple. By using regex forward matching as seen below, you are able to match any type of class. Remember to escape any "/" with a "\\" to prevent Regex from comitting seppuku and you spending hours figuring out what's wrong.

```java
// This will match any method with the name "main"
method{main} 
// This will match any method which starts with "com.apache" 
// (any class name replaces the "." with "/"
class{^com\/apache} 
```

### Inclusions
As opposed to exclusions, you may want to **only include a particular set of classes or a package** in your obfuscated jar. Fret not, this is possible, albeit a little more complicated.

```java
// This will match all classes of the package "com.example"
class{^(?!(com\/example)).*$} 

// This will match all classes of the package "com.example" and 
// all of the classes of the package "com.eclipse". 
// You may add as many packages as you wish with the "|" argument.
class{^(?!(com\/example)|(com\/eclipse)).*$} 
```

## Debugging Exclusions

I strongly recommend using a regex debugger, such as [Regex101](https://regex101.com/), to be able to figure out what matches and what does not. 

All class names, by default, follow the format "package1/package2/class1". Whilst you may see in the JVM it is formatted differently, in the case of Skidfuscator, the above format was decided to be the most effective and reflective of Jar/Zip file hierarchy.
